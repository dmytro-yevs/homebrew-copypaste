# CopyPaste CLI + daemon — Homebrew Formula.
#
# Like Casks/copypaste.rb, this file is both the checked-in source of truth and
# the template scripts/release/gen-formula.sh rewrites in place. Seeded with
# 0.0.0 and an all-zero sha256 so an unreleased copy fails closed.
#
# A formula rather than a cask because this is a plain pair of binaries, not an
# .app bundle — and because ADR-0001 notes the distinction matters: Homebrew's
# quarantine handling is Cask machinery, so the CLI does not need the postflight
# the cask carries.
#
# The binaries are still ad-hoc signed by the release pipeline. That is not
# about Gatekeeper: macOS on Apple Silicon refuses to execute an entirely
# unsigned Mach-O at all, so ad-hoc signing is the floor, not a nicety.

  # The daemon does not fork — README is explicit that backgrounding is the

  # launchd plist, which is why this project ships no plist of its own: v1
  # hand-wrote com.copypaste.daemon.plist plus an install-agent.sh to load it,
  # and that is precisely the kind of wheel CLAUDE.md rule 1 exists to stop.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      The daemon does not fork. Run it under launchd:
        brew services start copypaste-cli

      Or in the foreground:
        copypaste-daemon --foreground

      If you also installed the app (brew install --cask copypaste), run only
      one of them — two daemons would contend for the same socket.

    # Deliberately does not start a daemon: `brew test` runs in a sandbox with
    # no writable data directory, and a test that needs one would fail for
    # reasons that have nothing to do with the formula. `--version` proves the
    # binary was installed, is executable, and passes the ad-hoc signature
    # check macOS applies on first execution — which is the failure this test
    # is actually guarding against.
